  "model_output": "; META\n; task_restatement: Analyze three publicly listed AI companies in Japan by identifying each, gathering business and technical data, synthesizing the information, marking each analysis ready, and finally producing a consolidated report.\n; data_needed:\n; - three distinct company objects (company1, company2, company3)\n; - actions to identify, collect business data, collect technical data, synthesize, mark ready, and write final report\n; - constraints: a company must be identified before any data collection; both data types must be collected before synthesis; synthesis must precede marking ready; all three companies must be ready before the final report can be written\n; - goal predicate: final-report-written\n; data_collation:\n;   companies = {company1, company2, company3}   ; assumption: exactly three target companies exist\n;   initial_state = {}                           ; no predicates hold initially\n;   goal = (final-report-written)                ; desired final condition\n; reasoning_outline:\n; 1. Identify each company sequentially.\n; 2. For each identified company, collect business data then technical data.\n; 3. Synthesize the collected data for the company.\n; 4. Mark the company's analysis as ready.\n; 5.
