PDDL PLANNING RESULT
================================================================================

Below is a complete **PDDL‑style planning package** that captures every step you need to perform to (1) fully understand Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and (2) evaluate its outstanding warrants for dilution, premium and expected returns.  

The package contains three parts:

1. **Domain definition** – the actions you will execute, their pre‑conditions, effects and a short explanatory comment for each.  
2. **Problem instance** – the specific object (Occidental Petroleum) you will analyse and the goal (a finished report).  
3. **Executable plan** – the ordered list of actions that satisfies the goal, together with a practical “how‑to” note for each step.

Feel free to copy the blocks into separate `.pddl` files (e.g., `warrant-analysis-domain.pddl`, `analyze-occidental-problem.pddl`, `analyze-occidental-plan.txt`) and run them with any PDDL planner, or simply follow the plan manually – the comments give you the exact data sources and calculations you need.

### How to Use This Plan

1. **Set up a workspace** (e.g., a folder named `OXY_Warrant_Analysis`).  
2. **Save** the three code blocks above as the indicated file names.  
3. **Run a PDDL planner** (e.g., FastDownward, Metric‑FF) on the problem file; it will output the same ordered plan shown in Section 3.  
4. **Execute the actions manually** (or automate them with scripts). The `:comment` lines give you the exact tasks, data sources, and calculations required at each step.  
5. **Deliver the final report** (PDF/PowerPoint) once step 9 is completed – it will contain everything the user asked for: a full company understanding and a quantitative evaluation of the warrants (dilution impact, premium, and expected returns).  

Feel free to expand any step (e.g., add a Monte‑Carlo simulation for expected returns) by defining new actions in the domain and inserting them into the plan. The modular structure makes it easy to adapt the workflow to other companies or additional securities.
